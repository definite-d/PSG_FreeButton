# FreeButtonPSG (Experimental, Under Development)
FreeButton is an experimental plugin for [PySimpleGUI](https://GitHub.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to provide pseudo-rotated button text.

It will work basically by hiding the actual button text and replacing it with a dynamically generated image background with PIL.
